## Avr ZIFF Programmer

This simple utilitarian board makes use of a Ziff Socket and AVR ICSP headers to enable the programming of four different

* ATtiny85
* ATtiny84
* ATtiny2313
* ATmega328

It also has a FTDI adapter that works with the ATmega328

very handy for flashing a bunch of chips to put in kits. 

I am sharing this design on OSH park..
